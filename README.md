# Text-to-SQL LLM Application with Google Gemini Pro
This project demonstrates the development of an end-to-end Large Language Model (LLM) application using Google Gemini Pro for Text-to-SQL conversion and SQL query execution. The app allows users to input natural language queries, which are converted into SQL statements. The SQL queries are then executed against a connected SQL database to retrieve the relevant information.

# Features
Natural Language to SQL Conversion: Convert user input (natural language) into structured SQL queries using Google Gemini Pro.
SQL Query Execution: Run the generated SQL queries against a connected SQL database to fetch results.
User-Friendly Interface: An easy-to-use interface for querying the database without needing SQL knowledge.
Google Gemini Pro Integration: Powered by Google's advanced LLM, ensuring high accuracy in SQL query generation.
Prerequisites
Google Gemini Pro account for LLM API access.
SQL Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) with required tables and data for querying.
Python 3.7+ installed locally.
Required Python packages (see requirements.txt).
